## JavaScript PokeDex ##

This is a fun project based on the incredible PokeAPI. This API is an inexhaustible source of Pokemon data.

Here, you can find every detail corresponding to every Pokemon. I have tried to squeeze in as much information as possible through this project.

Evolution, moves, abilities, stats and much more. You name it, you got it.

Sit back and enjoy this project and do suggest other ideas or enhancements to make it even more interesting.

This is absolutely open source and can be used by anyone as a base template for creating something similar.
